That direcory contains set of scripts for FCMat->csv/ods->FCMat conversions.
The main purpose of conversion FCMAt->ods is to allow batch editing as
it's much easier to edit a column in spreadsheet than 25 separate FCMat files.
Also creating new materials similar to an existing material is just
a matter of copying a row, changing file names and relevant properties.

Typical workflow:

1. Run

	./make_ods.sh

   to create Materials.ods
2. Edit Materials.ods
3. Export to a csv file using | as field delimiter and " as text delimiter to Materials.csv
4. Run

	./cvs2FCMats Materials.csv

   to create directory with new FCMat files
5. Copy edited FCMat files to StandardMaterials directory

Important comments:
1. First 5 lines of a FCMat file are copied without modification to the new FCMat file
2. The scripts are to be used only on linux, in the source code directory.
4. unoconv has to be installed
5. The scripts should not be used to make small changes to the FCMat files
   or creating one new material - direct editing is easier.
